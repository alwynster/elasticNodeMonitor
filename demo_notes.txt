combine fpga, mcu, wireless
remove monitoring graph
axes labels
latency: two graphs (lines) on right hand image
convert all to power
right hand: energy usage per batch, latency per batch


fpga combine aux and internal
change latency to throughput graph
change experiment to be more one for x seconds, other for x seconds
energy usage also per query
ability to add hardware acceleration, while still remaining flexible as software would be, if your application requires high performance then this provides an alternative to offloading that performance. 
balance between flexibility, energy usage, and high performance. why elastic node? provide this balance using reconfigurable hardware.
poster: reconfigurable hardware, fpga, balance from elastic node, lookup table from acceleration. 
hardware acceleration as being changing physical structure, rather than virtual machines, simulated processors, 
system schematic figure showing system architecture, not with mw or other hardware components, if space then hardware overview of elastic node.
slide: high level explanation of problem that we're solving. comparison numbers. 
graphs on the poster, not on slide.

slide talk/slide: dont do it in cloud, do it local faster, dont do it in sw do it hardware accelerated, if you worried about flexibility theres a solution. if you have questions we will show you how to accelerate your application see my demo
